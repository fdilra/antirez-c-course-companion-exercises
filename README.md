Each lesson's directory is structured as follows:

exercise/
    questions.txt
    exercise.c
solution/
    answers.txt
    solution.c

Each "exercise" directory contains a set of questions related to the lesson and a practical programming exercise. 
The answers to the questions and a solution to the exercise can be found in the "solution" directory.
